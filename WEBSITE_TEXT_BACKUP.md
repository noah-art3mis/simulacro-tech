## About Page (`/about`)

### Main Heading
- **Title**: About

### Introduction Paragraphs
1. I'm Gustavo Costa. Before I wrote code, I worked as a clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst in Brasília, Brazil. That work taught me how to navigate complexity and ask better questions, rather than rushing to immediate solutions.

2. Now I build AI systems and conduct research at the intersection of technology and the humanities. This interdisciplinary experience showed me how optimization, when applied thoughtfully in humanistic contexts, can help systems better achieve their purpose.

3. Simulacro Tech is where I bring this together through a diverse range of technical solutions, including RAG systems, mixed-methods research, and data strategy -- all built with the same care I brought to clinical practice.
